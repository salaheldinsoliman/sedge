If you want to run a validator, make sure you have access to a remote or external consensus node.
	
You can use one of your own, a friend's node or providers such as Infura. Edit the .env file accordinly please, check that variable CC_NODE <-> (consensus endpoint) have the correct value. The validator node requires a high available consensus node, and consensus in turn needs a high available execution node.`
	ValidatorTips = `
A validator node needs to connect to a synced consensus node, and the consensus node in turn needs to connect to a synced execution node. 
	
While these required nodes (execution/consensus) are syncing, you can setup the keystore folder(s) using the staking-deposit-cli tool (https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) or the command 'sedge keys'. If you don't want to use 'sedge keys', make sure to set .env variables KEYSTORE_DIR and VL_DATA_DIR to correct values. You can also check https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ for tips and more instructions.
	
sedge will track the syncing progress of the required nodes and let you run the validator after those nodes are synced (as we recommend). This takes a while, so you have time to prepare the keystore folder.
	
Don't make the deposit to register the validator until its ready to run!!!
	
After you complete the above steps follow https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ instructions to register the validator addresses of the validators you want to setup and manage using the validator node.`
	HappyStaking = `
Validator is up. Remember to setup the keystore folder and to make the deposit. If something went wrong and your validator node is down, don't panic! Short downtimes are not very bad. Check the logs and try to fix the errors. Make sure errors are not related to connection issues with the consensus nodes nor related to the keystore folder path or validator data directory. You can start the validator again using the instructions displayed by the tool.
	
Happy Staking!
	`
	HappyStaking2 = `
You set the flag --run-clients=none which means the docker-compose scripts are generated but they will not be executed by sedge and the setup is stopped here. Normally sedge will run the execution and consensus services, wait for the execution and consensus client to sync and after that start the validator node, giving you instructions/recommendations about what to do in every step.
	
In case you don't know what to do next, please consider running sedge without the --run-clients flag (default behavior) and without the -r flag as well.
	
Follow https://launchpad.ethereum.org/ and happy staking!`
